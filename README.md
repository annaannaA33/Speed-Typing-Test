Speed Typing Test

This is a small application designed to measure typing speed. While the design is simple, the focus is on the logic and functionality of the application. This is my first JavaScript application that works.

Features
Text Display: Upon loading the application, a block of text is displayed.
Timer Activation: The timer starts when the user begins typing.
Highlighted Text: The character to be typed next is highlighted in blue. Correctly typed characters are displayed in green, while incorrectly typed characters are shown in red.
Result Display: After completing the test, the result is displayed along with the result of the previous test. A percentage comparison of the current result with the previous one is also shown.
History: The application keeps track of and displays the last 5 test results.
Retry Functionality: Press the Enter key or click the 'Try Again' button to restart the test with the same text.
Reset Functionality: Press the ESC key to reset the test with new text.
Technologies Used
Local Storage: Used for storing test results and other necessary data.
